    <h1>What is Swarm?</h1>
    <p>Swarm is an event-based social media that allows users to sign up for tickets, create events, and comment on events they are interested in. It utilizes a Node.js backend written in Javascript with a MongoDB database and a frontend written in Javascript, Vue.JS, and Bootstrap. Authorization is through Auth0</p>
    <h2>Who wrote Swarm?</h2>
    <p>Anne Hunt, a full stack web developer, during her work at Boise Codeworks.</p>
    <h2>Why is it called Swarm?</h2>
    <p>A meeting of a bunch of bees or yellow jackets is called a swarm. As a graduate of Black Hills State University (the Yellow Jackets) during the time when university branding was just becoming a big thing and the BHSU marketing department was busy putting a Yellow Jacket spin on every event, the word "Swarm" became ubiquitous in the area much to the annoyance of most students. It's a throwback to a very specific era and a bit of fun.</p>
