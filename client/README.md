## DESCRIPTION

Swarm is a full stack web application that utilizes a front end with Vue.js and Javascript and a backend written in Express/Node.js and MongoDB for the database. The application is designed to allow users to create events for others to attend. There are several set categories for the events. Users can filter events based on category and view a profile page to see what another user will be attending. Event creators can cancel events, events can sell out, and users can comment on events.
